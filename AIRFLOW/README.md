# Docker Compose: Web Application and Database

This is a Docker Compose setup for running a web application and database using Docker containers.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run Docker Compose.
4. Access the web application at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
5. To stop the containers, use `ctrl + c` in the terminal window running Docker Compose, or run the following command in a separate terminal window in the project directory.
   
## Configuration

- Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the configuration settings for the web application and database containers.
- Modify the `.env` file to change the environment variables for the containers.
- Add additional Docker containers to the `docker-compose.yml` file as needed.



# Notes on Airflow
s
1. Airflow is an open-source platform used for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows or data pipelines.
2. Airflow uses DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to represent workflows, which are made up of tasks that can run in parallel or sequentially.
3. Airflow can be run locally, on a cloud-based service, or in a containerized environment.
4. To run Airflow in a containerized environment, you need to define a Dockerfile that installs Airflow and any dependencies you need, and a docker-compose file to spin up the Airflow services and any additional services like a database or a message broker.
5. Airflow supports various databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. You need to set up a database for Airflow to store metadata and other information about your workflows.
6. Airflow uses Connections to store credentials and other information needed to connect to external systems like databases, cloud services, and APIs.
7. You can create Connections programmatically using Python code or manually using the Airflow web interface.
8. You can create custom Operators to perform specific tasks in your workflows, and you can define your own Macros and Variables to make your DAGs more flexible.
9. Airflow provides a web interface that allows you to monitor the status of your workflows, view logs, and trigger manual runs.
10. Finally, Airflow has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, such as integrations with cloud services, databases, and data visualization tools.
